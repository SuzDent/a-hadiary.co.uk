Unfortunately this is still not enough and the single fails to make the Top 100, only reaching No.154 in the UK charts.

<P>	<FONT COLOR="#C00000">Jeff Ayeroft from the mother-office of WEA, Warner Bros. in Los Angeles, who formerly signed artists such as The Police, Madonna and Prince, is made aware of a-ha and decides to give them a direct contract. In the meantime, P&aring;l goes to visit his girlfriend, Lauren Savoy, in Boston, USA. During his trip he phones Warner Brothers in America and to his surprise, they are already extremely positive about &quot;a-ha&quot; and have big plans for a for a new video to accompany their single &quot;Take On Me&quot;. Jeff Ayeroft flies the band over to Los Angeles for an experiment: he lets them walk through the corridors of the office to test the reaction of the girls working there. They provoke the effect he wanted to get: chaos!
<P><CENTER><IMG WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="200" SRC="diary_pics/tom3_video.jpg" ALT="Take On Me - video strip"></CENTER></P>
<P>The decision is made to re-record &quot;Take On Me&quot; with a different producer and to make a hundred-thousand pound semi-animated video to accompany the song. Jeff had seen an art cartoon (&quot;Commuter&quot; - later used in the &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; video) by Michael Patterson and had the idea of making a music video. Patterson, Steve Barron and Simon Field are hired for the video and spend the next three months drawing the cartoons and making a storyboard for the video. The remainder of the video is filmed in Kim's Cafe in Wandsworth, London. Once finished, the video is sent out to TV stations a month in advance of the single release. Due to the uniqueness (at that time) of the video, it quickly becomes much talked about and on high rotation. By the time the single is released, <nobr>a-ha</nobr> are already well known within the music industry and the single becomes very successful worldwide.</FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Four big TV-shows plus promotion in LA and New York are planned. Terry Slater selects exactly which shows they should be on - he says no to the Johnny Carson show because it is to family orientated. They also get the first offer for a Hollywood film during this period.

There are screaming teenagers waiting in the parking area for <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> to arrive and five of them have the chance to go into the studio to get hugs and autographs of the band during the live show. 
<BR>The next Radio interview is for the Station &quot;KIIS&quot;. After this <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> go to the &quot;CBS&quot; studios for a further radio interview; here they meet up with Paul Young who invites them to a concert and party the following day.

At the private party afterwards, <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> meet up with other stars like  King, Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Britt Ekland, Paul Young. <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> think about asking Dionne Warwick if she would pose for a photo with them, but before they get the chance, she asks for an autograph and a photo with them. They are the first to leave the party under orders by manager Terry Slater!
