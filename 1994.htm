The theme is international communication and comprehension of foreign cultures and is part of a campaign of the organisation &quot;World View&quot;. The LOOC (Lillehammer Olympic Organization Committee) was the initiative behind these concerts. It's not only a concert, but a multimedia show with songs, interviews, projections and comments. The two hour long concert begins with Karoline Kruger walking down the middle aisle in the church, picking the other solists out of the audience. These artists then sing some individual material; Morten performs songs from &quot;Poetenes Evangelium&quot; (&quot;Engelen&quot;, &quot;Fra Templet&quot; and &quot;Elisabet Synger Ved Johannes D&oslash;perens D&oslash;d&quot;). Some famous musicians play the instruments: Paolo Vinaccia on percussions, Arild Andersen on bass, Iver Kleive and Kjetil Bjerkestrand on keyboards and B&oslash;rge &Oslash;verleir on guitar. The last song, &quot;Den 4. verden&quot;, is sung by all of them together, joined also by Yuphin from Thailand and exil-state minister Seim Win of Bhurma. The profit from the two church concerts goes to &quot;World View&quot;.
