<H1>1987 - the year of Bond!</H1>
<P><FONT COLOR="#C00000">a-ha are amongst artists such as Queen and Paul McCartney who are asked if they would like to perform the new James Bond song. P&aring;l and Magne have already written the basis of a song which they feel would be suitable and send it in. This song is chosen to be used for the next James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. During the recording process of the song, it becomes apparent that John Barry has a problem with not being one of the song writers and therefore replaces Magne's name in the credits for his.</P>
<P>a-ha attend the BPI-awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London. An interview Morten and Magne in Munich (15.11.1986) is broadcast on the German TV show &quot;PIT&quot;.</FONT></P>

<BR>	<FONT COLOR="#C00000">	30	</FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	<NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> return to Norway to do their first live performance since they left in 1983. 
<BR>In Kristiansand, the band are interviewed and (only) Morten is given a Norwegian &quot;Setesdal&quot; sweater, which Magne and P&aring;l make fun of during the interview. Also &quot;Levis&quot; in Norway takes the opportunity to give <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> some denim jackets with the &quot;a-ha&quot; logo on it. These jackets sell out immediately after <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> are seen wearing them on TV shows. The Norwegian newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; claims that <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> pay for rooms in every hotel and guest house in Kristiansand to fool the fans and press who are trying to find out where they are staying.
<BR>The concert takes place at <FONT COLOR="#000080">Gimlehallen, Kristiansand, Norway</FONT> and 4,400 people attend. There are big problems with the concert as the tecnical equipment arrives late, two hours before the soundcheck is due to begin. In addition to that, a power failure in the district of the concert hall creates more problems. <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> again ask the press to sign a photo contract which most of the press boycott, except &quot;Stavanger Aftenblad&quot;, &quot;Se & H&oslash;r&quot;, &quot;S&oslash;ndag S&oslash;ndag&quot; and &quot;VG&quot;. As a result, only very few journalists get interviews and all press conferences during the Norwegian tour are cancelled. 
The support band are Norwegian &quot;Avenue Talk&quot; from Bergen and the Norwegian leg of the tour is sponsored by &quot;Agree&quot; shampoo.
<BR>	<FONT COLOR="#C00000">	31	</FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	The Norwegian TV show &quot;Frokost-TV&quot; shows a report on how Morten got a traditional Norwegian sweater which was made especially for him by Setesdal Husflidssentral in Valle.

<P><FONT COLOR="#C00000">In the summer, some filming for the movie &quot;Kamilla Og Tyven&quot; takes place in the South of Norway near Kristiansand. The film is the debut for the couple Grete Salomonsen Hunnekleiv and Odd Hunnekleiv of Penelope Film A/S and based on the &quot;Kamilla&quot; books by Kari Vinjes. The film is set in the summer of 1913. The main role of the little orphan girl is played by seven-year old Veronica Fl&aring;t from Mandal, the male main role of the girl's thief friend is played by Dennis Storh&oslash;y. Morten plays the part of the young Kristoffer who lives a modern lifestyle and brings new technology to the village (motorbike, car, plane). The film will also be released in English and dubbed into other languages, so all the scenes are first filmed in Norwegian and then a slightly different and shorter cut of the film is dubbed in English. The film is due to be released at Christmas, but is delayed until 24 March 1988 for the Easter market.</FONT></P>

<BR>The Royal Premiere of the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; is held in London.

John Barry takes this opportunity to speak out to the press about how difficult <NOBR>a-ha</NOBR> are to work with. The decision is made to neglect the song in the States and use another song as the title song for the U.S. version of the movie.
