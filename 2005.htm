The song was written in the wake of the Tsunami disaster to raise money for children orphaned by the earthquake. It's the first new song which Yusuf has recorded since 1978 and will be released in February. Martin Terefe, who has also worked with Magne on his solo album, was called to help out with the project. He put together a small band with Ed Harcourt, Neil Primrose (Travis), Magne, Jed Lynch and himself. Strings were added by David Davidson in Nashville and some vocals were added by AR Rahman in India. The song was recorded, mixed and sent to George Marino at Sterling, New York for mastering in less than a week.</FONT></P>
