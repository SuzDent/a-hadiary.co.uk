Morten and the former Plaza manager, Ole Andersen, own the restaurant which has been named after the opera &quot;Figaro's wedding&quot;.

Morten has made an agreement with &quot;Den Norske Opera&quot; to give young talented opera students the opportunity to play at Figaro's. On the first night, he sings accompanied by a British harpist (?).
<BR>As Magne had a dream, since working at the &quot;Henie Onstad Senter&quot;, H&oslash;vikodden during his gymnasium time, to have an exhibition here, P&aring;l, Kjell Nupen and others friends of his organise a &quot;fake exhibition&quot; in his name for his bachelor party. In the afternoon they open the exhibition that should last for one week (until 8th August) together with a surprised Magne. The exhibition is called &quot;Retrospective stunts&quot; and consists of 35 Polaroid pictures on black backgrounds and in black frames. Morten, who is occupied with the opening of his own restaurant &quot;Figaro&quot; in Akerbrygge, is unable to join them for this &quot;opening&quot;. After this, Magne celebrates his bachelor party at the restaurant Geysir in Oslo. Morten joins them and brings the biggest gift: a 90 cm tall penis made out of mince, made himself.
